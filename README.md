# 22Apr26-IMMRSV-WebDevInterviewTest


Please create "agenda.html" and "agenda-style.css" using the Airtable base and the XD wireframe you were invited to view.  

You have been provided the Airtable javascript file to pull from the Airtable API - 
  Please use the Table "Agenda" with the View "live-view" to pull the data. 
   Airtable REST documentation is provided here: https://airtable.com/api You will need to generate your API key here: https://airtable.com/account 

Please spend 2-3 hours on this between now and Sunday at midnight.

Need to have:
  -Create a site that shows all of the sessions for day one- making a new line for each session.
  -Each entry should show the name, presenter, room, time, and if a survey is available- a button to take the user to a prefilled survey link. All of this information is available in airtable and can be viewed through their UI as well as printed out as a record in the console.
  -Format should somewhat match wireframe, if there is a deviation- leave a comment and we can talk about it in the follow-up interview
  
If you finish the first task with plenty of time to spare, feel free to try one of these Possible add-ons:
  -If a session has its status set to "Live", change the background of that element from #FFFFFF to #EEFFE1
  -Collapsible divs that allow the user to click on the session name and reveal the description of the session
  -Use the "event-day" field to set the body background color to #D8E7E9 on "day-1" and #B8C0CE on "day-2"
